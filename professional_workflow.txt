Professional App Development Workflow

To build a production-grade application like Tayabli (Foodtech Marketplace), a professional follows a structured, iterative process.

Phase 1: Discovery & Strategy (The "Why" & "What")
- [x] Product Requirements Doc (PRD): Define features, user personas (Cook, Client, Courier), and success metrics.
- [x] Technical Feasibility: Choose stack (Flutter + NestJS), database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB), and third-party services (Maps, Payments).
- [ ] Design System: Create a UI kit (colors, typography, components) to ensure consistency.

Phase 2: Foundation & Architecture (The "How")
- [x] Monorepo Setup: Configure workspace (Nx/Turbo), linting, and formatting.
- [x] Backend Skeleton: Setup NestJS, database connection, authentication (JWT), and role-based access control (RBAC).
- [x] Mobile Skeleton: Setup Flutter, routing (GoRouter), state management (Bloc/Cubit), and API client (Dio).
- [ ] CI/CD Pipeline: Automate testing and building on push.

Phase 3: MVP Execution (Vertical Slices)
Build features end-to-end (Database -> API -> UI).

1. Authentication & Profiles
- [x] Login/Register (Phone/Email).
- [ ] KYC (ID verification for Cooks/Couriers).
- [ ] Profile Management.

2. Core Marketplace Loop
- [ ] Discovery: Home feed, search, filtering (Cuisine, Price).
- [ ] Ordering: Cart, Checkout, Payment Integration.
- [ ] Order Management:
    - Cook: Accept/Reject, "Ready for Pickup".
    - Courier: "Pick up", "Delivered".
    - Client: Real-time tracking.

3. Admin & Operations
- [ ] Dashboard: Global stats (Revenue, Active Users).
- [ ] User Management: Approve Cooks/Couriers.
- [ ] Dispute Resolution: Handle refunds and complaints.

Phase 4: Polish & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Testing: Unit tests (Business logic), Widget tests (UI), Integration tests (Flows).
- [ ] Performance: Optimize image loading, API response times, and app size.
- [ ] Security Audit: Penetration testing, data privacy compliance.

Phase 5: Launch & Growth
- [ ] Beta Testing: TestFlight/Play Console internal tracks.
- [ ] Analytics: Integrate tools (Firebase, Mixpanel) to track user behavior.
- [ ] Production Deployment: Cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), App Store submission.
